## Indicators

### Global indicators

- fossil emissions excluding carbonation
- land-use change emissions
- atmospheric growth
- ocean sink
- land sink
- cement carbonation sink
- budget imbalance

Notes:

- there are 2 series for these indicators, one covers 1959-2019 and
  the other covers 1750-2019
- 2020 estimations not included
- The methods used to estimate the historical fluxes differ from the
  carbon budget presented from 1959 onwards. For example, the
  atmospheric growth and ocean sink do not account for year-to-year
  variability before 1958
- individual model estimations for these indicators not included in
  this dataset
- fossil emissions by fuel type not included in this dataset

### National indicators

- territorial emissions
- consumption emissions
- emissions transfers
- bunker fuel emissions and statistical difference (between the world
  emissions and the sum of the emissions for each countries and for
  the bunker fuels) for above 3 indicators
