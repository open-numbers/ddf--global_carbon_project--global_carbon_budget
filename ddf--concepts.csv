land_use_change_emissions,land-use change emissions,Emissions from land-use change (uncertainty of ±0.7 GtC/yr):,GtC/yr,measure,
atmospheric_growth,atmospheric growth,"The atmospheric CO2 growth rate (variable uncertainty around 0.2 GtC/yr from 1980) is estimated directly from atmospheric CO2 concentration measurements, and provided by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Earth System Research Laboratory (NOAA/ESRL).  http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/global.html",GtC/yr,measure,
ocean_sink,ocean sink,The ocean sink (uncertainty of ±0.5 GtC/yr) is estimated from the average of several global ocean biogeochemistry models that reproduce the observed mean ocean sink of the 1990s. ,GtC/yr,measure,
land_sink,land sink,The land sink (uncertainty of ±0.9 GtC/yr on average) was estimated from the average of several dynamic global vegetation models that reproduce the observed mean total land sink of the 1990s.,GtC/yr,measure,
budget_imbalance,budget imbalance,The budget imbalance is the sum of emissions (fossil fuel and industry + land-use change) minus (atmospheric growth + ocean sink + land sink); it is a measure of our imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. ,GtC/yr,measure,
